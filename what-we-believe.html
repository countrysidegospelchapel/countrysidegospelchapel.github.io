		The Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired Word of God, without error in the original writings, the 
		complete revelation of His will for salvation of men and the Divine and final authority for Christian faith and life.
		<br/>2Timothy 3:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2Peter 1:20-21</p>
		
		<p>In one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three persons:
		Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
		<br/>Genesis 1:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew 28:19</p>
		
		<p>That Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He died on the cross, a sacrifice for our sins. Further, He arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven where at the right hand of the Majesty, on high, He is now our High Priest and Advocate.
		<br/>Matthew 1:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John 1:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans 3:23-25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Corinthians 15:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 John 2:1-2</p>
		
		<p>That the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, and during this age, to convict men, regenerate the believing sinner, and indwell, guide, instruct and empower the believer for godly living and service.
		<br/>John 16:7-14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephesians 1: 13-14</p>
		
		<p>That man was created in the image of God but fell into sin and is therefore lost, and only through regeneration by the Holy Spirit can salvation and spiritual life be obtained.
		<br/>Genesis 1:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genesis 3: 1-6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John 3:1-7</p>
		<p>That the shed blood of  Jesus Christ and His Resurrection provide the only ground for justification and salvation for all who believe, and only such as receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy Spirit and, thus become children of God.
		<br/>Romans 5:1-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galatians 3:13</p>
	
		<p>That water baptism and the Lord’s Supper are ordinances to be observed by the church during the present age. They are however, not to be regarded as means of salvation.
		<br/>Matthew 28:19-20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke 22:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acts 2:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Corinthians 11:23-32</p>
		
		<p>That the true Church is composed of all such persons, who through saving faith in Jesus Christ, have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and are united together in the Body of Christ of which he is the head.
		<br/>Romans 12:5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acts 2:47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephesians 1:22-23</p>
		
		<p>In the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and that this “Blessed Hope” has a vital bearing on the personal life and service of the believer.
		<br/>John 14:3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acts 1:9-11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 John 3:1-3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1Thessalonians 4:16-17</p>
		
		<p>Bodily resurrection of the dead believer, to the everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord, and to the unbeliever judgment, and everlasting conscious punishment.
		<br/>1 Corinthians 15: 51-52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John 5:28-29</p>
