         <h1>How to be Saved</h1>
         <hr/>
         <p>It is the most important thing you will ever do in
         your life! Everyone who ever lived was born with a nature that sins. A
         sin is something you do, say, or even think, that is not what God would
         have wanted you to do. We all sin every day. And the punishment for our
         sins, even one sin, is banishment from God's presence when we die. An eternity
         in hell.
         <p>Being saved is being saved from an eternity in hell. There is one way
         to be saved, and only one way, through putting your complete trust in Jesus
         Christ. That is what God said in Romans 10:8-10 ...The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
         <p>It is just that simple. No good works can do it. No sacrifice of yours
         can do it. Simply trusting in the completed work of Jesus will make you immediately, completely and irrevocably saved.
